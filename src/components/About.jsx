            Hello! I'm Topaja Saha, a 2024 Computer Science Engineering graduate
            with a strong foundation in front-end development. I've built my
            skills through online courses and hands-on projects, turning
            concepts into real, interactive experiences. My learning journey has
            been driven by curiosity, consistency, and a passion for building
            meaningful interfaces. I'm equally drawn to design and development,
            aiming to create user experiences that are both intuitive and
            visually engaging. I'm excited to contribute to a forward-thinking
            organization, collaborate with talented teams, and take on impactful
            challenges. My goal is to grow continuously while adding value
            through creativity and code.
